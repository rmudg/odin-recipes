    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Lets get one thing straight: We love chicken Parmesan, but we’ve had our fair share of mediocre versions. So we took it upon ourselves to do a deep dive into this iconic dish. Six weeks, 20 pounds of chicken, and several arguments later, we came up with our Platonic ideal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Medium onions</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Combine garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil in a large baking dish</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, garlic powder, onion powder, ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or Morton kosher salt, and 2 Tbsp. water in a large shallow bowl</li>
        <li>Dredge in panko, pressing firmly to adhere, ensuring no bare spots remain</li>
        <li>Heat over medium until an instant-read thermometer registers 400°</li>
        <li>Serve!</li>
    </ol>
